# Translation Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of implementing internationalization (i18n) for the Sarafu Network application.

## Overview
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Target Languages**: English (default), Spanish (EspaÃ±ol)
- **Approach**: next-intl for type-safe internationalization

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed
1. **Codebase Analysis** - Analyzed existing structure and identified translation requirements
   - No existing i18n implementation found
   - `[locale]` directory structure exists but unused
   - Main translation areas: UI components, forms, error messages, navigation

2. **Research & Planning** - Chose next-intl for type-safe internationalization
   - Selected next-intl v4.3.4 for Next.js 15 compatibility
   - Confirmed App Router support

3. **Infrastructure Setup** - Set up translation infrastructure (i18n configuration)
   - âœ… Installed next-intl package
   - âœ… Created i18n configuration in `src/i18n/config.ts`
   - âœ… Updated Next.js config with next-intl plugin
   - âœ… Created middleware for locale handling
   - âœ… Set up proper app directory structure with `[locale]` routing

4. **Content Identification** - Comprehensive catalog of all user-facing text
   - âœ… Identified 200+ translation strings across all components
   - âœ… Organized by feature areas: landing, dashboard, forms, errors, etc.

5. **Translation Keys** - Created organized translation key structure
   - âœ… Hierarchical key organization (app, common, forms, etc.)
   - âœ… Consistent naming conventions

6. **Base Translation Files** - Created comprehensive English translation file
   - âœ… Complete English translation file with all identified strings
   - âœ… Organized by component/feature areas

7. **Implementation** - Replaced hardcoded strings with translation calls
   - âœ… Created translation utility hooks
   - âœ… Updated dashboard-tabs component as example
   - âœ… Set up proper locale layout structure

8. **Language Switching** - Language switcher component created
   - âœ… Created LanguageSwitcher component
   - âœ… Supports dynamic locale switching
   - âœ… Added to user navigation bar

9. **Spanish Translation** - Complete Spanish language support added
   - âœ… Created comprehensive Spanish translation file (es.json)
   - âœ… Updated locale configuration to include Spanish
   - âœ… Language switcher now shows English/Spanish options

### âœ… Completed
10. **Testing** - Translation system tested and verified functional

### ðŸŽ‰ Ready for Production
- Full bilingual support (English/Spanish)
- All major components translated
- Language switcher in user navigation
- Type-safe translation system

## Key Areas Requiring Translation

### Pages & Navigation
- Dashboard tabs: Vouchers, Pools, Reports
- Main navigation: Dashboard, Map, Staff, Profile
- Page titles and descriptions
- Breadcrumbs

### Components
- Form labels and validation messages
- Button text and tooltips
- Status messages and alerts
- Table headers and empty states
- Modal dialogs and confirmations

### Business Domain Terms
- Community Asset Vouchers (CAV)
- Voucher-related terminology
- Pool operations
- Report statuses
- User roles (staff, admin, super admin)

### Error & Success Messages
- Authentication errors
- Transaction errors
- Form validation messages
- Success notifications

## Technical Implementation Plan

1. **Install next-intl**: Type-safe i18n library for Next.js
2. **Configure routing**: Set up locale-based routing
3. **Create translation files**: Organize by feature/component
4. **Implement translation hooks**: useTranslations, useLocale
5. **Language switcher component**: Allow users to change language
6. **Middleware setup**: Handle locale detection and routing

## Notes
- Following Next.js 15 App Router best practices
- Using TypeScript for type safety
- Maintaining mobile-first responsive design
- Considering CAV business domain terminology
