            <p>
              An organization or individual applies for an audit and
              verification with GEF. This applicant is hereinafter referred to
              as Client. By using Sarafu-Credit in paper form or digitally

              herein. SC Trading Network acts as a facilitator for the
              development of a trading network and auditor of all vouchers
              issued to the client. Client is an individual or legal entity that
              willingly uses the SC Trading Network to trade its goods and or

              facilitate barter trade exchange services.

            <strong>2. NATURE OF SC VOUCHERS and TOKENS</strong>
            <p>
              A &apos;trade&apos; is a purchase or sale of goods and or services
              whereby payment is made via barter using SC Vouchers or Tokens
              pursuant to the terms contained in this Agreement. A SC Voucher or
              Token is an accounting unit used to record the value of a trade
              -SC as well as each Token has a viable exchange rate to Kenyan
              Shillings at the time of trade. Ownership of SC or Tokens on SC
              Network denotes the acceptance of a gift and no right to receive
              goods or services available within the SC Trading Network
              Marketplace. SC may be used only in the manner and for the purpose
              set forth in this Agreement; SC will not be considered legal
              tender, securities or commodities and may not be redeemed for
              Kenyan Shillings. SC Trading Network disclaims responsibility for
              the negotiability of SC or for the availability of goods and
              services from any source. SC physical printed vouchers are issued
              with an expiration date or maturity period called the term. At the
              end of the term SC has no redeemable value for barter exchanges.
              All SC in any Client account will be subject to an automatic
              holding tax on a weekly or monthly basis.

            <strong>3. STANDARDS AND TRANSPARENCY</strong>
            <p>
              As a responsible third party record keeper and auditor, SC Trading
              Network facilitates the development and operation of peer-to-peer
              Client&apos;s mutual-credit clearing systems. Each client is
              audited for the number of members that qualify for a SC Voucher
              allotment. This verification process involves a questionnaire and
              the establishment of local guarantors for the new Client member.
              The amount of SC Vouchers allocated to the Client depends on the
              size and types of members therin. The vouchers issued are to be
              used as the vouchers of each businesses among the client.

            <strong>4. TRADE COORDINATING FUNCTION</strong>
            <p>
              SC Trading Network serves in a trade coordinating capacity in
              organizing and facilitating trade among Clients and members of
              Clients. Responsibility for the conduct of a trade is exclusively
              that of the Clients and members of the Client participating in the
              trade. The duty to inspect goods for quality and quantity and
              fitness for purpose, to evaluate the quality of services, or to
              obtain or act upon any warranty rests upon the buyer Client. SC
              Trading Network will use its best efforts to broker the
              Client&apos;s SC into goods and services, to accurately record
              trades, and to administer Client agreements and trading rules in
              accordance with their terms. However, Client acknowledges that the
              sole principals in any trades are the buying and selling Clients
              involved, that the trades are entered into voluntarily and that SC
              Trading Network is not the guarantor of any product, service or
              token. SC Vouchers are ultimately and fully backed by the assets,
              goods and services of the Client.

              in the system and transact business through the network and agree
              to abide by the same terms and conditions of all Clients. Any SC
              Vouchers or Tokens associated must be audited, allocated and
              maintained using the same criteria that are applied to all Client
              accounts. Such Clients shall have no privileged access to goods or

              businesses as Clients, having goods or services to satisfy the
              needs of all Clients. Because of high Client demand and short

            <p>
              Either party may terminate this agreement, with or without cause,
              upon ten (10) days written notice to the other party. Upon
              termination, all cash and trade credit service fees outstanding
              become due and payable; transaction fees are non-refundable. If
              Client has a negative SC balance (purchases exceed sales) at the
              time of termination, Client must balance the account with trade
              credit within thirty (30) days of the termination date. If any
              negative trade balance remains after the thirty (30) day period,
              Client shall immediately pay SC Trading Network any remaining
              balance in cash. Failure to repay within the required time-scale
              will result in immediate legal proceedings being instigated to
              recover the debt in cash Kenyan Schillings (KSH) and any legal
              costs incurred. SC Trading Network reserves the right to transfer
              the debt to a Debt Collection Agency. If Client has a positive SC
              balance (sales exceed purchases) at the time of termination,
              Client may stay active for a period of thirty (30) days for the
              purpose of making purchase trades only until purchases equal sales
              by paying SC Trading Network in advance the cash service fees on
              the positive SC balance, until SC Vouchers are spent. Any positive
              SC Voucher balance not spent within thirty (30) days of
              termination shall be forfeited by Client and will be considered
              forfeited.

              ceases to do business, all Clients in a negative trade position
              will pay amounts they owe in cash (one trade Voucher being equal
              to one Kenyan Shillings) into a fund. The fund, less expenses,
              plus any SC Trading Network inventory will be distributed pro rata
              to all Clients who are in a positive trade position. Thus, all
              Clients in a positive position will receive cash and/or goods for
              their trade dollars to the extent that the funds permit. SC
              Trading Network shall not be liable to any Client&apos;s cash or
              trade Vouchers beyond the distribution of such funds as aforesaid.
              Cessation of the SC Trading Network&apos;s operations does not
              release any Client from liability to make any payment due to SC

              <li>
                Central Bank of Kenya Act Cap 491 - S.21 states that : &quot;All
                monetary obligations or transactions entered into or made in
                Kenya shall be deemed to be expressed and recorded, and shall be
                settled, in Kenya currency unless otherwise provided for by law
                or agreed upon between the parties&quot; The highlighted part in
                section 21 above gives parties in a transaction the leeway to
                decide what &quot;currency&quot; to use when transacting
                Consequently , it is my belief that one can chose to use Kenyan
                currency , Foreign currency or barter for goods /services so
                long as the parties are in agreement
              </li>
              <li>
                Interpretation and General Provisions Act Cap 2 - S.3: This Act
                defines the word sell as follows : “sell” includes barter,
                exchange and offer to sell or expose for sale..&quot;
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              From this and other statutes examined , barter trade is envisaged
              as part of normal trading .i.e. a normal buying and selling
              transaction in the Kenyan market.
            </p>
            <strong>
              None of the Statutes reviewed expressly prohibits or deems barter
              trade as an illegal activity
            </strong>
            <p>
              Conclusion: Barter Trade is a legal method of transacting between
              parties . In my view therefore, an illegality will only arise
              where the Foundation attempts to counterfeit currency - which is
              an offense with very steep penalties under Kenyan law ( See Penal
              Code - Cap 63). Also note that usage of Bangla-Pesa an example SC
              Voucher was deemed legal haven&apos;t not violated any laws under
              the CBK or KRA act by the office of the D.P.P.
